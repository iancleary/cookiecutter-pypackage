# Cookiecutter python module

## The Basic Idea

This is a template module collecting many utilities I have liked from other projects, to serve as a personal reference.
- [https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/)
- [https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter)

## Getting started with this template

```bash
pip install --user cookiecutter

$ cookiecutter https://github.com/iancleary/cookiecutter-pypackage
# For the sake of brevity, repos on GitHub can just use the 'gh' prefix
$ cookiecutter gh:iancleary/cookiecutter-pypackage
```

Only **Python 3.6+** is supported as required by the black, pydantic packages
